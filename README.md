# 🔍 Real-Time Anomaly Detection using Kafka and Spark

This project implements a real-time anomaly detection pipeline using Apache Kafka for streaming data, Apache Spark for distributed processing, and a trained machine learning model for detecting anomalies on-the-fly.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This pipeline is built for real-time anomaly detection in streaming data environments. It captures live data from Kafka topics, processes it using Spark Structured Streaming, and flags anomalies using a trained machine learning model.
